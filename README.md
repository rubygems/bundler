# Bundler: a gem to bundle gems

Bundler is a tool that manages gem dependencies for your ruby application. It
takes a gem manifest file and is able to fetch, download, and install the gems
and all child dependencies specified in this manifest. It can manage any update
to the gem manifest file and update the bundle's gems accordingly. It also lets
you run any ruby code in context of the bundle's gem environment.
