bundle-platform(1) -- Displays platform compatibility information
=================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle platform` [--ruby]

## DESCRIPTION

`platform` will display information from your gems.rb, gems.locked, and Ruby
VM about your platform.

For instance, using this gems.rb(5):

    source "https://rubygems.org"

    ruby "1.9.3"

    gem "rack"

If you run `bundle platform` on Ruby 1.9.3, it will display the following output:

    Your platform is: x86_64-linux

    Your app has gems that work on these platforms:
    * ruby

    Your gems.rb specifies a Ruby version requirement:
    * ruby 1.9.3

    Your current platform satisfies the Ruby version requirement.

`platform` will list all the platforms in your `gems.locked` as well as the
`ruby` directive if applicable from your gems.rb(5). It will also let you know
if the `ruby` directive requirement has been met. If `ruby` directive doesn't
match the running Ruby VM, it will tell you what part does not.

## OPTIONS

  parse it from the gems.rb(5).
