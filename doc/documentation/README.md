# Documentation

Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. Because of that, we welcome documentation suggestions and patches from everyone, especially if they are brand new to using Bundler.

Currently, Bundler has two main sources of documentation:

1. built-in `help` (including usage information and man pages)
2. [Bundler documentation site](http://bundler.io)

If you have a suggestion or proposed change for [bundler.io](http://bundler.io), please open an issue or send a pull request to the [bundler-site](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site) repository.

Not sure where to write documentation? In general, follow these guidelines:

* For an explanation of a specific Bundler command (ex: `bundle clean`): make changes to the man pages
* For longer explanations or usage guides (ex: "Using Bundler with Rails"): create new documentation within the [bundler-site](https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site) repository

If you are unsure where to begin, ping [@feministy](https://github.com/feministy) or [@indirect](https://github.com/indirect) in the Bundler Slack ([get an invite here](../contributing/GETTING_HELP.md)).

## [Writing docs for man pages)](WRITING.md)

If you’d like to submit a patch to the man pages, you're in the right place! Details on editing and previewing changes to man pages can be found here.

## [Documentation vision](VISION.md)

Just like Bundler, we have a grand plan (really, a wish list of sorts) for Bundler documentation. Preview our hopes and dreams for our documentation here.

## Translations

We don't currently have any translations, but please reach out to us if you would like to help get this going.
