.TH "BUNDLE\-UPDATE" "1" "September 2010" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbundle\-update\fR \- Update your gems to the latest available versions
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbundle update\fR \fI*gems\fR [\-\-source=NAME]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Update the gems specified (all gems, if none are specified), ignoring the previously installed gems specified in the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR\. In general, you should use bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR to install the same exact gems and versions across machines\.
.
.P
You would use \fBbundle update\fR to explicitly update the version of a gem\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-\-source=<name>\fR
The name of a \fB:git\fR or \fB:path\fR source used in the Gemfile(5)\. For instance, with a \fB:git\fR source of \fBhttp://github\.com/rails/rails\.git\fR, you would call \fBbundle update \-\-source rails\fR
.
.SH "UPDATING ALL GEMS"
If you run \fBbundle update\fR with no parameters, bundler will ignore any previously installed gems and resolve all dependencies again based on the latest versions of all gems available in the sources\.
.
.P
Consider the following Gemfile(5):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

source "http://rubygems\.org"

gem "rails", "3\.0\.0\.rc"
gem "nokogiri"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
When you run bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR the first time, bundler will resolve all of the dependencies, all the way down, and install what you need:

.P
As you can see, even though you have just two gems in the Gemfile(5), your application actually needs 25 different gems in order to run\. Bundler remembers the exact versions it installed in \fBGemfile\.lock\fR\. The next time you run bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR, bundler skips the dependency resolution and installs the same gems as it installed last time\.
.
.P
After checking in the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR into version control and cloning it on another machine, running bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR will \fIstill\fR install the gems that you installed last time\. You don\'t need to worry that a new release of \fBerubis\fR or \fBmail\fR changes the gems you use\.
.
.P
However, from time to time, you might want to update the gems you are using to the newest versions that still match the gems in your Gemfile(5)\.
.
.P
To do this, run \fBbundle update\fR, which will ignore the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR, and resolve all the dependencies again\. Keep in mind that this process can result in a significantly different set of the 25 gems, based on the requirements of new gems that the gem authors released since the last time you ran \fBbundle update\fR\.
.
.SH "UPDATING A LIST OF GEMS"
Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave the rest of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR\.
.
.P
For instance, in the scenario above, imagine that \fBnokogiri\fR releases version \fB1\.4\.4\fR, and you want to update it \fIwithout\fR updating Rails and all of its dependencies\. To do this, run \fBbundle update nokogiri\fR\.
.
.P
Bundler will update \fBnokogiri\fR and any of its dependencies, but leave alone Rails and its dependencies\.
.
.SH "OVERLAPPING DEPENDENCIES"
Sometimes, multiple gems declared in your Gemfile(5) are satisfied by the same second\-level dependency\. For instance, consider the case of \fBthin\fR and \fBrack\-perftools\-profiler\fR\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

source "http://rubygems\.org"

gem "thin"
gem "rack\-perftools\-profiler"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBthin\fR gem depends on \fBrack >= 1\.0\fR, while \fBrack\-perftools\-profiler\fR depends on \fBrack ~> 1\.0\fR\. If you run bundle install, you get:
.
.IP "" 4

Installing daemons (1\.1\.0)
Installing eventmachine (0\.12\.10) with native extensions
Installing open4 (1\.0\.1)
Installing perftools\.rb (0\.4\.7) with native extensions
Installing rack (1\.2\.1)
Installing rack\-perftools_profiler (0\.0\.2)
Installing thin (1\.2\.7) with native extensions
Using bundler (1\.0\.0\.rc\.3)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In this case, the two gems have their own set of dependencies, but they share \fBrack\fR in common\. If you run \fBbundle update thin\fR, bundler will update \fBdaemons\fR, \fBeventmachine\fR and \fBrack\fR, which are dependencies of \fBthin\fR, but not \fBopen4\fR or \fBperftools\.rb\fR, which are dependencies of \fBrack\-perftools_profiler\fR\. Note that \fBbundle update thin\fR will update \fBrack\fR even though it\'s \fIalso\fR a dependency of \fBrack\-perftools_profiler\fR\.
.
.P
\fBIn short\fR, when you update a gem using \fBbundle update\fR, bundler will update all dependencies of that gem, including those that are also dependencies of another gem\.
.
.P
In this scenario, updating the \fBthin\fR version manually in the Gemfile(5), and then running bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR will only update \fBdaemons\fR and \fBeventmachine\fR, but not \fBrack\fR\. For more information, see the \fBCONSERVATIVE UPDATING\fR section of bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR\.
.
.SH "RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW"
In general, when working with an application managed with bundler, you should use the following workflow:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
After you create your Gemfile(5) for the first time, run
.
.IP
$ bundle install
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Check the resulting \fBGemfile\.lock\fR into version control
.
.IP
$ git add Gemfile\.lock
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When checking out this repository on another development machine, run
.
.IP
$ bundle install
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When checking out this repository on a deployment machine, run
.
.IP
$ bundle install \-\-deployment
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
After changing the Gemfile(5) to reflect a new or update dependency, run
.
.IP
$ bundle install
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Make sure to check the updated \fBGemfile\.lock\fR into version control
.
.IP
$ git add Gemfile\.lock
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR reports a conflict, manually update the specific gems that you changed in the Gemfile(5)
.
.IP
$ bundle update rails thin
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you want to update all the gems to the latest possible versions that still match the gems listed in the Gemfile(5), run
.
.IP
$ bundle update
.
