.TH "BUNDLE\-PACKAGE" "1" "September 2010" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbundle\-package\fR \- Package your needed \fB\.gem\fR files into your application
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbundle package\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Copy all of the \fB\.gem\fR files needed to run the application into the \fBvendor/cache\fR directory\. In the future, when running bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR, use the gems in the cache in preference to the ones on \fBrubygems\.org\fR\.
.
.SH "GIT AND PATH GEMS"
In Bundler 1\.0, the \fBbundle package\fR command only packages \fB\.gem\fR files, not gems specified using the \fB:git\fR or \fB:path\fR options\. This will likely change in the future\.
.
.SH "REMOTE FETCHING"
By default, if you simply run bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR after running bundle package(1) \fIbundle\-package\.1\.html\fR, bundler will still connect to \fBrubygems\.org\fR to check whether a platform\-specific gem exists for any of the gems in \fBvendor/cache\fR\.
.
.P
For instance, consider this Gemfile(5):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

source "http://rubygems\.org"

gem "nokogiri"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If you run \fBbundle package\fR under C Ruby, bundler will retrieve the version of \fBnokogiri\fR for the \fB"ruby"\fR platform\. If you deploy to JRuby and run \fBbundle install\fR, bundler is forced to check to see whether a \fB"java"\fR platformed \fBnokogiri\fR exists\.
.
.P
Even though the \fBnokogiri\fR gem for the Ruby platform is \fItechnically\fR acceptable on JRuby, it actually has a C extension that does not run on JRuby\. As a result, bundler will, by default, still connect to \fBrubygems\.org\fR to check whether it has a version of one of your gems more specific to your platform\.
.
.P
This problem is also not just limited to the \fB"java"\fR platform\. A similar (common) problem can happen when developing on Windows and deploying to Linux, or even when developing on OSX and deploying to Linux\.
.
.P
If you know for sure that the gems packaged in \fBvendor/cache\fR are appropriate for the platform you are on, you can run \fBbundle install \-\-local\fR to skip checking for more appropriate gems, and just use the ones in \fBvendor/cache\fR\.
.
.P
One way to be sure that you have the right platformed versions of all your gems is to run \fBbundle package\fR on an identical machine and check in the gems\. For instance, you can run \fBbundle package\fR on an identical staging box during your staging process, and check in the \fBvendor/cache\fR before deploying to production\.
